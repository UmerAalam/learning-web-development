        <p>Dear Agent <b class="blur"> S'more,</b></p>
        <p>We have an emergency. The secret formula for our <b class="blur">Mega Marshmallow</b> has been compromised. This formula is what makes our marshmallows the fluffiest and most delicious.</p>
        <p>We suspect that <b class="blur">Professor Puff</b> is behind this. He has taken the formula to his hidden laboratory. Your mission is to infiltrate the lab and secure the formula before it's too late.</p>
        <p>Be sure to keep the lab's location confidential. Any leak of this information could jeopardize the entire operation.</p>
